# This file is for the operator computations
# Python operators are used to perfom operations on variables or values

# Types of Python Operators
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# 2. Logical Operators
# 3. Assignment Operators
# 4. Comparison Operators
# 5. Identity Operators
# 6. Membership Operators
# 7. Bitwise Operators


# Arithmetic Operators
# Addition (+)
x = 4
y = 6

z = x + y
print(z)
# Subtraction (-)

a = y - x
print(a)
# Multiplication (*)

j = x * y
print(j)
# Division (/)

k = x / y
print(k)

# Exponentiation (**)

r = x**2
f = x**3

# Modulus (%)
i = y % x
print(i)


# Comparison Operators
# Greater than (>)
print(x > y)

# Less than (<)
print(x < y)

# Equal (==)
print(x == y)

# Not equal (!=)
print(x != y)


# Greater than or equal (>=)
print(x >= y)

# Less than or equal ( <=)
print(x <= y)
